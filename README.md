Learning Java

Welcome to my Java learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I explore the fundamentals of Java programming. 

Getting Started

Installation: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Oracle website or opt for an open-source alternative like OpenJDK.
IDE Selection: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your Java code. Popular choices include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans.
